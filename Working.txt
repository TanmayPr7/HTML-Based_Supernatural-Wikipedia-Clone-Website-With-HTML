Basically, it's a Supernatural Wikipedia Page project, created using only HTML.
A few of its features include design without CSS, alignement, etc.
Contains all the features of the Wikipedia Page & many more. As a beginner, this is a fun,
exciting, and challenging project that I personally enjoyed making with any help of CSS.
For this project there are no specific working principles, but as a habit,
I leave a little note in every project stating the working principle,  and so here it is.

This is the basic working principle & personal note on this Web Dev Project:)
